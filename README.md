# SQL-Exercises-And-Solutions
This repository includes all the exercises that I have solved while learning SQL.

The topics that I've covered are SQL Joins, SubQueries, Aggregate Functions and Strings. 

I have also created different branches for these topics so you can checkout to those branches if you want to see separately.
